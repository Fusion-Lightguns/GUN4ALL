## Info

- P.I.G.S  is designed to be all in one open source Light Gun eco system. It has [PCBs](https://github.com/Fusion-Lightguns/P.I.G.S-PCBs), [GUI (general user interface)](https://github.com/Fusion-Lightguns/P.I.G.S-GUI), prebuilt Light Guns by [Fusion LightGuns](fusionlightguns.com), [DIY instructions](https://github.com/Fusion-Lightguns/P.I.G.S--Pico-Infared-Gun-System/tree/plus/DIY), [build videos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWwdJLmLOawdj0-UQUi_1tA), [3D printable lightguns](https://www.thingiverse.com/fusion_lightguns/designs), [3D printable LED cases](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6119123), custom boards(LG2040) & more!!!
- Designed for multi player useage on many frontends . I have a few setup & test all the time.
- Designed from over a year of messing with Lightguns, code and parts.


## Credits/History ##
- Orginally I started with [Prow Enhanced fork](https://github.com/Prow7/ir-light-gun) to [SAMCO's project](https://github.com/samuelballantyne/IR-Light-Gun), added solenoid & rumble support & misc stuff. See it here [Fusion Prow7 Edits](https://github.com/Fusion-Lightguns/Fusion-Light-Gun). Then I found & forked [SeongGino's Gun4ALL](https://github.com/SeongGino/ir-light-gun-plus) which is based on the [Prow Enhanced fork](https://github.com/Prow7/ir-light-gun), which in itself is based on the 4IR Beta "Big Code Update" [SAMCO's project](https://github.com/samuelballantyne/IR-Light-Gun)
- I liked Gun4ALL but wanted things a little different. Thus P.I.G.S was born.
