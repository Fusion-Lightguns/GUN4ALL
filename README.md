## P.I.G.S (Pico Gun System) ##

# Credits/History #
- Orginally I started with Prow7's enhancments to Samco, added solenoid & rumble support & misc stuff. See it here [Fusion Prow7 Edits](https://github.com/Fusion-Lightguns/Fusion-Light-Gun). Then I found & forked [SeongGino's Gun4ALL](https://github.com/SeongGino/ir-light-gun-plus) which is based on the [Prow Enhanced fork](https://github.com/Prow7/ir-light-gun), which in itself is based on the 4IR Beta "Big Code Update" [SAMCO's project](https://github.com/samuelballantyne/IR-Light-Gun)
- I liked Gun4ALL but wanted things a little different. Thus P.I.G.S was born.
