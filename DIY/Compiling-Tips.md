## Tips for compiling P.I.G.S to your liking.

- Figure out what you dont like lol.
- Make a literal or mental list.

 ## FYI
- Button mappings are mainly assigned by playerBTN variables.

## Warnings 
- Changing PID, VID etc will make it a "new device" your pc will have to setup agian and you might loose frontend support.
